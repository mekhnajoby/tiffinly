# My Deliveries Page Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the `my_deliveries.php` page for delivery partners. This page will display orders that have been accepted by the delivery partner and allow them to update the status of those deliveries.

## Database Structure Analysis
The existing database structure is sufficient for this feature:
- The `delivery_assignments` table tracks which partner has accepted which subscription
- It includes status tracking (pending, out_for_delivery, delivered, cancelled)
- No database changes are required

## Page Structure
The page should follow the same structure as other delivery partner pages:
1. Sidebar navigation (copied from available_orders.php or partner_dashboard.php)
2. Main content area with header
3. Order cards displaying delivery information
4. Status update functionality

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Authentication Check
- Verify user is logged in and has 'delivery' role
- Redirect to login page if not authenticated

### 2. Data Retrieval
- Fetch orders assigned to the current delivery partner
- Join with necessary tables to get complete order information:
  - subscriptions (for plan details, dates, etc.)
  - users (for customer name and phone)
  - meal_plans (for plan name)
  - delivery_preferences (for meal types and time slots)
  - addresses (for delivery addresses)

### 3. Order Display
- Group orders by subscription_id
- Display each order in a card format similar to available_orders.php
- Show:
  - Order ID
  - Customer name and phone
  - Plan name and schedule
  - Start and end dates
  - Total price
  - Meal types with time slots and addresses
  - Current status

### 4. Status Update Functionality
- Allow delivery partner to update status:
  - Pending → Out for Delivery
  - Out for Delivery → Delivered
- Include update buttons for each status transition
- Form submission to update_status.php or direct database update

## Database Query
```sql
SELECT 
    da.assignment_id,
    da.subscription_id,
    da.status as delivery_status,
    s.user_id,
    s.plan_id,
    s.start_date,
    s.end_date,
    s.schedule,
    s.total_price,
    u.name as user_name,
    u.phone,
    mp.plan_name,
    dp.meal_type,
    dp.time_slot,
    a.line1,
    a.line2,
    a.city,
    a.state,
    a.pincode,
    a.landmark
FROM delivery_assignments da
JOIN subscriptions s ON da.subscription_id = s.subscription_id
JOIN users u ON s.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN meal_plans mp ON s.plan_id = mp.plan_id
JOIN delivery_preferences dp ON dp.user_id = s.user_id AND dp.meal_type = da.meal_type
JOIN addresses a ON a.address_id = dp.address_id
WHERE da.partner_id = ? AND da.status != 'delivered' AND da.status != 'cancelled'
ORDER BY da.subscription_id, dp.meal_type
```

## UI Components
1. Header section with page title
2. Order cards with:
   - Customer information
   - Plan details
   - Meal information with time slots and addresses
   - Current status display
   - Status update buttons
3. Consistent styling with other delivery partner pages
4. Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Status Flow
1. Pending: Order has been accepted but not yet picked up for delivery
2. Out for Delivery: Partner has picked up the order and is delivering it
3. Delivered: Order has been successfully delivered

## Implementation Steps
1. Create the basic page structure with authentication check
2. Implement database connection and query to fetch assigned orders
3. Create the UI components to display orders in cards
4. Add status update functionality
5. Apply consistent styling to match other delivery partner pages
6. Test the page functionality

## Required Files
- delivery/my_deliveries.php (main page)
- May need to modify update_status.php to handle redirects back to my_deliveries.php

## Notes
- The page should only show orders that are assigned to the current delivery partner
- Delivered and cancelled orders should not be displayed
- The status update functionality should be simple and intuitive
